Melanie: What device? We don't have anything down here. We haven't been working on anything for years. Everything we had been working on is in our main displays in the lobby. #melanie05

Melanie: Well there simply isn't. #melanie06

//Max mumbles: Found... it... #max13
Max: I found the file you were looking for.

Melanie: About time. Any questions?

->	Max: What about a new part?
		//Max mumbles: "No... New... part?" #max14
		Max: So I can't create a new part?

		Melanie: There was only a single unit ever created, due to the fact this project was purely experimental.
		Melanie:Because of the lost schematics, the only way to make the machine work was if there was another part somewhere.

->	Max: But a new part will fix this?
		//Max mumbles: "Can... I... Fix... This..."
		Max: So you're saying that if I either find a way to fix the machine, or get a new part, the machine will be functional again?

		Melanie: Yes, that would be the case.
		Melanie: By getting a new part, we can repair it to its full capacity.
		Melanie: Hopefully, we could fix all the shame we brought upon ourselves.

->	Stop bluffing.
		Max: Stop bluffing, I know there is something behind that door. #max07
		Max: The CPU broke. #max08

		Melanie: Wait... What? How... could you possibly know that? #melanie08

->	Max: I know a lot more.
		//Max mumbles: I... Know... All... #max09
		Max: I know lots of things, like how you authorized the improper use of the machine.
		Max: How Bridger R&D wanted to abuse this device to make a profit of innocents.
		Max: Like how your guilt and shame mean more than your job.

		Melanie: ...

Max: I can help you fix this mess.

Melanie: You certainly are good at your job. But fixing this machine is impossible. #melanie09

->	Max: What do you mean by "Fixing it is impossible"?
		//Max mumbles: Impossible?
		Melanie: Well. Ummm. We, ehh... lost... the schematics. A poor filing choice from an intern. #melanie10

->	Max: Does no one know that it broke?
		//Max mumbles: Who... knows #max11
		Melanie: We hid it, out of shame.
		Melanie: No one knows besides the team that worked on it.
		Melanie: We had to think about what would happen if someone did find out about it.
		Melanie: It also has other uses, some less... economical, and dangerous in the wrong hands. #melanie11

->	Max: More gross incompetence.
		//Max mumbles: Pure... Incompetence #max12
		Max: The sad thing is, the machine would have worked.
		Max: In a separate dimension, the machine worked to clean the air.
		Max: Greenery populates the world.

		Melanie: Jesus ... .You can travel dimensions?
		<<wait  1>>
		Melanie: I'm getting off track.
		Melanie: I suppose it's comforting to know the machine was used for its correct purpose. That is what we designed the machine for.
		Melanie: We are responsible for bringing doom upon ourselves by modifying the machine.
		Melanie: We made the wrong choice and paid dearly for it.
