Melanie: About time. Any questions?

->	Max: What about a new part?
		<<set $audioMaxNumber = 14>>
		<<playvoicemax DialogueManager>>
		Max: So I can't create a new part?
		<<playvoicemel DialogueManager>>
		Melanie: There was only a single unit ever created, due to the fact this project was purely experimental.
		Melanie:Because of the lost schematics, the only way to make the machine work was if there was another part somewhere.

->	Max: But a new part will fix this?
		<<set $audioMaxNumber = 15>>
		<<playvoicemax DialogueManager>>
		Max: So you're saying that if I secure this CPU component, this machine could be reproduced?
		<<playvoicemel DialogueManager>>
		Melanie: Yes, that would be the case.
		Melanie: We don't have much use for ours without it being repaired to its full capacity.
		Melanie: Maybe you could make use of it?

		Max: Like how your guilt and shame mean more than your job.

		Melanie: ...

Max: I can help you fix this mess.

->	Max: Impossible?
		<<set $audioMaxNumber = 10>>

		Max: What do you mean by "Fixing it is impossible"?
		<<playvoicemel DialogueManager>>
		Melanie: Well. Ummm. We, ehh... lost... the schematics. A poor filing choice from an intern. #melanie10

->	Max: Who knows?
		<<set $audioMaxNumber = 11>>
		<<playvoicemax DialogueManager>>
		Max: Does no one know that it broke?
		<<playvoicemel DialogueManager>>
		Melanie: We hid it, out of shame.
		Melanie: No one knows besides the team that worked on it.
		Melanie: We had to think about what would happen if someone did find out about it.
		Melanie: It also has other uses, some less... economical, and dangerous in the wrong hands. #melanie11

->	Max: Pure incompetence.
		<<set $audioMaxNumber = 12>>
		<<playvoicemax DialogueManager>>
		Max: More gross incompetence.
		Max: The sad thing is, the machine would have worked.
		Max: In a separate dimension, the machine worked to clean the air.
		Max: Greenery populates the world.
		<<playvoicemel DialogueManager>>
		Melanie: Jesus ... .You can travel dimensions?
		<<wait  1>>
		Melanie: I'm getting off track.
		Melanie: I suppose it's comforting to know the machine was used for its correct purpose. That is what we designed the machine for.
		Melanie: We are responsible for bringing doom upon ourselves by modifying the machine.
		Melanie: We made the wrong choice and paid dearly for it.
