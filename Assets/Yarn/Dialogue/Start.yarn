Max: Hello Mario, it's so good to meet you finally.

Mario: I've seen-a your progress in-a my castle.

Mario: You've come so-a far. I'm so-a proud of you.

Mario: I'm-a go in the pipe!

Max: Goodbye Mario!

Mario: I-a love you!

Mario: It's-a me, Mario that loves you!

The plumber jumps a few feet in the air, the sound of a spring echoing throughout the castle halls.

Max readied herself.

Bowser awaits.
